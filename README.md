# supplier2opens.py

**Created by**: Aiden Olsen

supplier2opens is a python script that allows the automatic conversion from
different supplier lists/carts to the OPEnS shopping list format saving lost of time.

The program takes in a csv or excel spreadsheet containing the necessary information
required for the OPEnS shopping list. The script then organized the data correctly
and copies the formatted contents to you clipboard to be easily pasted into the OPEnS
shopping list.

Currently the following suppliers lists/carts are supported:

- [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) Lists
- [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/) Shopping Carts

## üé• Demo:
